# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# quiz = Quiz.create!(title: 'culture')
# question = Question.create!(quiz: Quiz.first, 
#   description: 'Which number is divisible by 2 and 3', 
#   answers_attributes: [
#   { value: 1 },
#   { value: 2 },
#   { value: 3 },
#   { value: 6, is_correct: true },
